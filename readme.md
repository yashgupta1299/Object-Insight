### [Report-Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvuCKaUOvUbtLJME_SyRolhpWh4IZ_ewfyxYrHk_N4o/edit?usp=sharing)

> - Tools used: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Python
> - Concepts: CNN, Receptive Field, Guided-backpropagation, Grad-CAM
> - Developed an object feature visualizer using the VGG19 Model with Receptive Field computation,
>   Guided-backpropagation algorithm, and Grad-CAM class activation visualization. A detailed report was
>   created about the analysis of the different techniques used.
